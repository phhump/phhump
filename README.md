- ⚡ Fun fact: The first ever digital image was of a baby! In 1957, Russell Kirsch, a scientist at the U.S. National Bureau of Standards, scanned a photograph of his infant son using a drum scanner, creating a 176x176 pixel digital image.
- This tiny black-and-white image marked the beginning of digital image processing and paved the way for modern image editing software we use today.
